# goodreads-calendar-alert
Script that uses Goodreads' free API to extract books added to the user's 'to-read' shelf and creates an event in their Google Calendar on the book's release date, if it is a future release.

Implemented in two forms:
- Python (no longer maintained)
- Javascript (Google Apps Script)
